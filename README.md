# GoShare - A Ride-Hailing App for Everyone

## Introduction

GoShare is a ride-hailing application designed with a focus on technology-beginner passengers like the elderly and children. Unlike other transportation apps that are often complex due to their multitude of functions, GoShare aims to provide a simplified user interface making it easy for everyone to navigate.

## The Problem We're Solving

Many transportation apps today are not user-friendly for those who are new to technology. They often have too many functions, making it hard for users to find the right service. Furthermore, these apps generally target a broad user base, neglecting specific groups like housewives, the elderly, and young children. GoShare addresses these issues by providing a simplified and safe platform for these users.

## Features

GoShare offers a range of features tailored to our users' needs:

### For Customers

- Profile setup with personal information and contact details.
- Easy booking to desired destinations.
- Criteria selection for trips.
- Creation of planned locations for immediate trip booking.
- Real-time route tracking with a map.
- In-app wallet and cash payment options.
- Driver rating and feedback system.
- Past trip history view.
- Booking trips for dependents.
- Emergency assistance call to guardian.
- Dependent location tracking.

### For Drivers

- Profile setup with personal information and contact details.
- Option to accept or refuse a trip request.
- Income management within the app.
- Direction guidance to passenger’s destination.
- Shortest path to the destination on the map.

### For Admins

- Revenue tracking by region, city, time of day, etc.
- User information management.

- Driver application approval or rejection.
- Transaction view of an account in the system.

## Limitations

- The application currently only supports the Vietnamese language.
- Food and package delivery services are not included.
- Only one account can be logged in on each device at a time.

## Future Scope

We have several features planned for future releases:

- Making video calls.
- Live view of current GoShare drivers nearby.
- Price adjustment depending on current traffic and weather.
- Chat with images, audios, or videos.
- Speech-to-text search location.
- Payment with Momo, ZaloPay wallet.

We believe that GoShare will make ride-hailing a breeze for everyone. Join us in our journey to make transportation easy, safe, and reliable for all!
